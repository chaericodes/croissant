        buttery texture and crescent shape. Today, they are enjoyed by people of
        all cultures and have become an integral part of the global pastry

          Croissants are believed to have originated in Austria, not France as
          many people commonly think. The pastry's precursor is the "kipferl," a
          crescent-shaped pastry that was popular in Austria and other parts of
          Europe as early as the 13th century. The kipferl is thought to have
          been inspired by the crescent moon, a symbol associated with the
          Ottoman Empire.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Flour</li>
          <li>Butter</li>
          <li>Yeast</li>
          <li>Milk</li>
          <li>Sugar and salt</li>
          <li>Eggs</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Procedure</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Croissant dough is a laminated dough, which means it's folded with
            layers of butter to create a flaky texture. This process typically
            involves multiple folds and chilling between each fold.
          </li>
          <li>
            The dough is mixed with yeast, milk, sugar, and salt and then rolled
            out into a rectangular shape.
          </li>
          <li>
            Cold butter is placed on one-half of the dough, and then the other
            half is folded over the butter. This creates a butter layer within
            the dough.
          </li>
          <li>
            The dough is then folded multiple times, with rests in between, to
            create layers. This process is known as "turns."
          </li>
          <li>
            After the dough has been properly laminated, it's rolled out into a
            large rectangle.
          </li>
          <li>
            It is then cut into triangles or rectangles, depending on the
            desired shape of the croissants.
          </li>
          <li>
            The shaped croissants are allowed to rise or proof for a period,
            usually a few hours or overnight. This allows the yeast to ferment
            and the croissants to expand.
          </li>
          <li>
            Croissants are typically baked in a preheated oven until they are
            golden brown and have a crispy exterior.
          </li>
          <li>
            The high-fat content in the dough causes the layers to separate
            during baking, resulting in the characteristic flakiness.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Serving</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Croissants can be served in various ways. They are often enjoyed
            plain, but they can also be filled or topped with ingredients like
            chocolate, almond paste, ham, or cheese.
          </li>
          <li>
            Croissants are a common breakfast item and are often paired with
            coffee or hot chocolate.
          </li>
          <li>
            They can also be used to make sandwiches or enjoyed as a snack.
