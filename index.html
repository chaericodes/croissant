        Croissants have a rich history that began in Austria and were refined in
        France, where they became a beloved pastry known for their flaky,
        buttery texture and crescent shape. Today, they are enjoyed by people of
        all cultures and have become an integral part of the global pastry
        landscape.

          Croissants are believed to have originated in Austria, not France as
          many people commonly think. The pastry's precursor is the "kipferl," a
          crescent-shaped pastry that was popular in Austria and other parts of
          Europe as early as the 13th century. The kipferl is thought to have
          been inspired by the crescent moon, a symbol associated with the
          Ottoman Empire.
